<h1>About Me</h1>
  
<p>Hello! I'm a passionate and aspiring web developer currently pursuing my first year of engineering at the Army Institute of Technology, Pune, in the Information Technology branch. With a keen interest in technology and problem-solving, I have embarked on my journey to explore the vast world of web development. My goal is to build dynamic and user-friendly websites that enhance digital experiences and provide innovative solutions.</p>

<p>At present, I am focusing on strengthening my web development skills, starting with the fundamentals. I have learned HTML, which allows me to structure web pages effectively, and I am eager to dive deeper into CSS and JavaScript to create more interactive and visually appealing websites. Every day, I strive to expand my knowledge, working on small projects and experimenting with different web design techniques.</p>

<p>I am enthusiastic about continuous learning and always open to new challenges. As I progress in my journey, I aim to master front-end and back-end technologies to become a full-stack developer. I am excited to collaborate with like-minded individuals, contribute to meaningful projects, and grow in the ever-evolving field of web development. Feel free to connect with me as I explore and build the web, one line of code at a time!</p>
